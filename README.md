# Weather

Little project I did for a job interview assignment:


Weather Widget
Create a weather widget for use in the webbrowser that provides us with a weather forecast.

We've included an 'icons' folder for your use.

We recommend using the free DarkSky weather API. You can register a free account which will allow for up to a thousand requests per day. Note; the DarkSky API does not provide CORS headers, you will need to either use a public CORS anywhere service (see also: link), or include your own within the project

Things to consider:

We recommend that you use a framework (ie: Angular, React, VueJS)
You should be able to explain the reasoning behind your choices
Assessment
For the assessment of this test we will review all aspects of the work delivered. The assignment is intentionally left vague such as to enable you to show yourself from your best side. You can score points with anything/everything, so long as it is done well.
